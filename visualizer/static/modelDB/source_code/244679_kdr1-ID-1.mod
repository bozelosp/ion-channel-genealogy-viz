TITLE Delayed rectifire
 
COMMENT
HVA-VGKC (HVAK). Starting from the formulation of the âdelayed rectifier channelâ given in De
Schutter and Bower, 1994, The HVAK kinetic parameters were modified to account for the
behaviours at depolarised states. Specifically, the activation curve was multiplied by a sigmoid
function to track the occurrence of the first Ca 2+ spike. Then the activation time was decreased by
~95% to reproduce the number and shape of the observed Ca 2+ spikes. Notably, this is the only
channel for which the experimental pharmacological block was not available.

Current Model Reference: Karima Ait Ouares , Luiza Filipis , Alexandra Tzilivaki , Panayiota Poirazi , Marco Canepari (2018) Two distinct sets of Ca 2+ and K + channels 
are activated at different membrane potential by the climbing fibre synaptic potential in Purkinje neuron dendrites.
